Johnny's website: a work-in-progress.

I solve problems. I learn as I go. This website is an example of that. I am curious about data and draw insights from them, my projects demonstrate that in one form or another. If I can't get the data, I'll develop hardware and software to do that.

I'm not all science and engineering; I've been teaching myself how to play guitar, learned how to do barre chords last year! (Note: Barre chords are the hardest chords to do and require using your index finger to 'bar' all the strings). I have also learned how to dance, both solo and ballroom, over the years.

Friends, colleagues, and former students comment my explanations are helpful and thorough, so I can teach too.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
